# Conways Game of Life in Bevy

This is a simple simulation of conway's game of life in bevy, a data-oriented rust game engine.
I did this project in order to learn both more about bevy in specific as it was shown to me to be
a powerful modern game engine, as well as learn more about data-oriented programming.

To run this program you will need to have Cargo install and then simply run `cargo run` / `cargo r` in the root of the repository.

## Controls:
WASD to pan
Scroll in / out for Zoom
Left/Right Click to add or erase a cell when the simulation is stopped
